### Working with the file
- You can use a translation menu to help on translating and you can review it later if it correct. Using "Translation" > "Translate all" on Translation section
- You can use a suggestion on current text you translating. Using "Suggest" on Translation section
- The "State Filter" section will be useful if you working with that language before. You can uncheck "Translated" to hide all the text you already translate.
- "Source" show the original text of it. Put your translation in the "Translation" below.
- All the text you have to translate is store in "Strings" tab below. You can filter it out using "State Filter" above. The text will automatically gain "Translated" state when you write the text into translation, "Need Reviews" is when the text from en-US source is changed. Most of the time it probably fix a typo or capital letter but you can update if the meaning of the text is changed in your language. "New" state is when the translation hasn't been translate yet.
